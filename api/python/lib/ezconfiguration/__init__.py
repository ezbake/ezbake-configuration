Ezbake Configuration for Python

Reads configuration from package data in config/ezbake-config.properties

Modules that import any of the ezconfig modules can override properties by
including their own config/ezbake-config.properties

ex)
    mypackage/
        -mymodule.py
        -config/
            -ezbake-config.properties

    mymodule.py:
    import ezconfig.zookeeper

NOTE: the configuration properties are loaded when ezconfig._config is imported
    (by any of the helper modules), so only the first module's
    config/ezbake-config.properties can be used
